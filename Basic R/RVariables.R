"A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. A variable in R can store an
atomic vector, group of atomic vectors or a combination of many Robjects. A valid variable name consists
of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot
not followed by a number.

#Variable Assignment:
#The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and equal to operator. The values of the
#variables can be printed using print() or cat()function. The cat() function combines multiple items into a
#continuous print output.

# Assignment using equal operator.
var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)
# Assignment using leftward operator.
var.2 <- c("learn","R")
# Assignment using rightward operator.
c(TRUE,1) -> var.3
print(var.1)
cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"\n")
cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"\n")
cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"\n")
cat("---------------------------------------","\n")
#Note - The vector c(TRUE,1) has a mix of logical and numeric class. So logical class is coerced to numeric
#class making TRUE as 1.

#Data Type of a Variable
#In R, a variable itself is not declared of any data type, rather it gets the data type of the R - object assigned
#to it. So R is called a dynamically typed language, which means that we can change a variableâ€™s data type
#of the same variable again and again when using it in a program.

var_x <- "Hello"
cat("The class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")
var_x <- 34.5
cat(" Now the class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")
var_x <- 27L
cat(" Next the class of var_x becomes ",class(var_x),"\n")

cat("---------------------------------------","\n")

#Finding variables
print(ls())


#Deleting Variables
rm(var.3)
print(var.3)#This gives error who is var.3???
